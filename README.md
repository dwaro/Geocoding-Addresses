# Geocoding-Addresses

This Jupyter Notebook shows an example of how I returned thousands of coordinates for cooperatives that were missing latitude and longitude data.  It makes use of Bing's and Google's location API, and uses X's for place holders.  Working on augmenting the process to a more API-like build as well as adding in Yahoo's location API for another level of quality in geolocation services.
